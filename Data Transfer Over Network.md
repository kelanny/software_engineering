# Data transfer over network
We transfer data over a network, and in doing so, we have to find a way to thell the data where to go.
We use [[IP Addresses]] to get data to the right system
###### how does it know which application is listening in that system?
Let's look at it in a different perspective

##### The  hospital analogy 

If i give you woke up feelin sick and i give you a street address  to the nearest hospital, you will be able to find exact hospital within its neighborhood
But how will you find the reception, or the doctor's office, the lab, or the pharmacy?
Each of this room server different functions and this is where a [[port]] comes in.

So to continue with the house analogy,  If i gave you the street address and a room number, that would take you to the exact room that offers the service you are lookin for. 
Similar kind of a process is used to exchange data between systems on the internet where the [[IP Addresses]] is the equivalent of street address that identify the particular system and the [[port]] equivalent of room number identify with the particular service you want to access in the  system

The data sent through the internet is inform of [[IPv4 Packet]].
All the information in the packet make up the IPv4 Packet header

###### TCP Header


###### UDP Header
