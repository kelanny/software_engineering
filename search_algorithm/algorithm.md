In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), an **algorithm**  is a [finite](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/finite "mwod:finite") sequence of [mathematically rigorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigour#Mathematics "Rigour") instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific [problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem "Computational problem") or to perform a [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation "Computation").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm#cite_note-:0-1) 
Algorithms are used as specifications for performing [calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation "Calculation") and [data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing "Data processing"). More advanced algorithms can use [conditionals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming) "Conditional (computer programming)") to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as [automated decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_decision-making "Automated decision-making")) and deduce valid [inferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference "Inference") (referred to as [automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning "Automated reasoning")), achieving [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation "Automation") eventually. Using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing "Alan Turing") with terms such as "memory", "search" and "stimulus".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm#cite_note-:1-2)
