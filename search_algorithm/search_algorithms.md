- In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), a **search algorithm** is an [[algorithm]] designed to solve a [search problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_problem "Search problem")
- Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure"), or calculated in the [search space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region "Feasible region") of a problem domain, with [either discrete or continuous values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable "Continuous or discrete variable")
- The most appropriate search algorithm to use oftenly depends on the data structure being searched and may also include prior knowledge about the data.
- Search algorithms can be made faster or more efficient by specially constructed data structures, such as search trees, hash maps and database indexes
- They can be classified into 3 types based on their mechanism i.e linear, binary and hashing.

##### Linear search 
This algorithm checks every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion

##### Binary search
- also known as half interval repeatedly target's the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half
- This algorithm can be applied on data structures with defined order.
- Digital search algorithms work based on  the properties of digits in data structure by using numerical keys.

##### Hashing
- This algorithm works by directly mapping keys to records based on a [[hash function]] 

Algorithms are often evaluated by their computational complexities, or maximum theoretical run time.
For example, binary search functions, have a maximum complexity of 0(log n), or logarithmic time, In simple terms, the maximum number of operations needed to find the search target is a logarithmic function of the size of the search space


### Applications of search algorithms

Specific applications of search algorithms include:

- Problems in [combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization "Combinatorial optimization"), such as:
    - The [vehicle routing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem "Vehicle routing problem"), a form of [shortest path problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem "Shortest path problem")
    - The [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem "Knapsack problem"): Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
    - The [nurse scheduling problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_scheduling_problem "Nurse scheduling problem")
- Problems in [constraint satisfaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction "Constraint satisfaction"), such as:
    - The [map coloring problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_coloring_problem "Map coloring problem")
    - Filling in a [sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku "Sudoku") or [crossword puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword_puzzle "Crossword puzzle")
- In [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory "Game theory") and especially [combinatorial game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory "Combinatorial game theory"), choosing the best move to make next (such as with the [minmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minmax "Minmax") algorithm)
- Finding a combination or password from the whole set of possibilities
- [Factoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization "Factorization") an integer (an important problem in [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography"))
- Optimizing an industrial process, such as a [chemical reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction"), by changing the parameters of the process (like temperature, pressure, and pH)
- Retrieving a record from a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database "Database")
- Finding the maximum or minimum value in a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type) "List (abstract data type)") or [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure "Array data structure")
- Checking to see if a given value is present in a set of values
