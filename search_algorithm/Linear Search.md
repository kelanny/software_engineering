Linear search is one of the simplest search algorithms. It involves sequentially checking each element in a list or array until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached. Here's a basic outline of how it works:

1. Start from the first element in the list.
2. Compare the target value with the current element.
3. If the current element matches the target value, return its index.
4. If the current element does not match the target value, move to the next element.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until either the target value is found or the end of the list is reached.

Linear search has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This means that in the worst-case scenario, where the target element is not present in the list or is located at the end of the list, the algorithm may have to check every element.

While linear search is straightforward and easy to implement, it may not be the most efficient option for large datasets. Other search algorithms like binary search or hash tables offer better time complexities for certain scenarios. However, linear search can still be useful in situations where the dataset is small or unsorted, or when the overhead of implementing more complex algorithms is not justified.
