# The Browser
Whenever you issue a URL from your browser to get a web resource using HTTP, e.g. `http://www.nowhere123.com/index.html`, the browser turns the URL into a _request message_ and sends it to the HTTP server. 

The HTTP server interprets the request message, and returns you an appropriate response message, which is either the resource you requested or an error message. This process is illustrated below:
